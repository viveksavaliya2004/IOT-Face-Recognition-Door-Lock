🔐 IoT-Based Touchless Door Lock System Using ESP32-CAM

📌 Overview

This project presents an IoT-based smart door locking system that uses facial recognition through the ESP32-CAM module. The system provides touchless and secure access control without requiring physical keys.

The door unlocks only when an authorized face is detected. If an unauthorized face is detected, the system alerts the owner.

🧠 Working Principle

ESP32-CAM captures face image.

Face detection algorithm verifies identity.

If face is authorized → Relay activates → Door unlocks.

If unauthorized → Alert is generated.
